# principal_component_analysis_iris_dataset

The principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is widely used in dimensionality reduction for extracting relavent features in a dataset before using the dataset for building a predictive model.

This code illustrates how the PCA algorithm can be implement in R using the iris dataset:
